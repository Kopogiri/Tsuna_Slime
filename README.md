# Tsuna_SlimeVR
Case Designs + PCB to get you easily set up using BNO085 for SlimeVR.

Supports GY-BNO08X as the main tracker and either GY or Adafruit BNO08X as the aux. Fitted for JST-XH connectors.
Remember that no 3D printer prints 1:1 so some files may print differently depending on your printer. I would suggest ordering the PCB, printing the main case and making sure the PCB fits. Then print the lid and make any adjustments necessary.
